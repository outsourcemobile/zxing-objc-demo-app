GITHUB NOTES - June 5, 2011

For whatever reason - the ZXingApp xcode project "ZXingMac" did not get sent along with the other files in the "ZxingApp" folder. 

The implication is that all of this GIT activity will get to be performed yet again as it still is not a correctly configured repository. 

Apologies - the Mgmt.
