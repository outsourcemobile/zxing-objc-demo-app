GITHUB NOTES - June 5, 2011

For whatever reason - the ZXingApp xcode project "ZXingMac" did not get sent along with the other files in the "ZxingApp" folder. 

The implication is that all of this GIT activity was that, yet again, the repository was re-created to accurately reflect the complete and correct contents of the various materials.

Apologies - the Mgmt.
